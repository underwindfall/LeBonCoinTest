## Explanations

### Clean Architecture
clean architecture stands for a group of practices that produce systems that are:

- Independent of Frameworks.
- Testable.
- Independent of UI.
- Independent of any external agency.

### MVVM
MVVM is more simple and modern way to use in these years. It's recommended by Google, ViewModel has all features Presenter,
you can consider it as Presenter layer. Besides that, ViewModel has lifecycle scope with Activity or Fragment,
it's more convient and it can persisit state when you rotate the view.

### Reactive Extensions
- I konw Leboncoin is using a lot things in Rx, That's the one of reason to show my ability.
- I like Rx, all of things in your whole application could be reactive which is great.
